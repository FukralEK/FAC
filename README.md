# FAC 
FAC is my own archive format created for my future projects like video games etc. It's not really complete and shouldn't be used in any projects in its current state. I plan to add more features and polish up the code a litle.
# Goals
*Add compression
*Add Encryption
*Add error handling
*Port most of the code to C APIs
*Polish the code up a litle
