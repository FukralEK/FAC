# FAC 
FAC is my own archive format created for my future projects like video games etc. It's not really complete and shouldn't be used in any projects in its current state. I plan to add more features and polish up the code a litle.
# Goals
* Add error handling
* Add compression
* Add Encryption
* Port most of the code to C APIs
* Polish the code up a litle
* Create documentation
